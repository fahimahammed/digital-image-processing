## Overview
This repository contains the lab tasks for the Digital Image Processing course (CSE4182). The tasks are designed to provide hands-on experience in various image processing techniques using Python and relevant libraries.

### Lab Tasks
- **Task 1: Take the grayscale image of size 512x512 & perform the following operations -**
	- (a) Decrease its spatial resolution by half every time & observe its change when displaying in the same window size
	- (b) Decrease its intensity level resolution by one bit up to reach its binary format & observe its change when displaying in the same window size
	- (c) Illustrate the histogram of the image & make single threshold segmentation observed from the histogram
- **Task 2: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512 & perform the following operations –**
	- (a) Perform the brightness enhancement of a specific range of gray levels & observe its result
	- (b) Differentiate the results of power law & inverse logarithmic transformation 
	- (c) Find the difference image between original & the image obtained by last three MSBs
- **Task 3: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some salt-and-pepper noise & perform the following operations –**
	- (a) Apply average & median spatial filters with 5x5 mask & observe their performance for noise suppression in term of PSNR 
	- (b) Apply average filter with (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) mask with average filter & observe their performance in term of PSNR 
	- (c) Apply harmonic & geometric mean filter on the noisy image & compare their performance with PSNR 
- **Task 4: Take a grayscale image of size 512x512, add some Gaussian noise & perform the following operations in the frequency domain –**
	- (a) Apply 4th order Butterworth & Gaussian low-pass filter to analyze their performance quantitatively 
	- (b) Display the ringing effect of the ideal low-pass filter of different radius on the image 
	- (c) Perform edge detection of given the noisy & clean image using ideal & Gaussian high-pass filters 
 - **Task 5: Take a binary image & perform the following morphological operations –**
	- (a) Perform Erosion & Dilation operations
	- (b) Opening & Closing operations 
	- (c) Boundary extraction using morphological operation
